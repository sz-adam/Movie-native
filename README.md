# My React Native Movie & Series App

This project is an extension of my first React project, now developed into a React Native application. It utilizes the [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) for fetching movie and series data.

- **Carousel Showcase**: The homepage features a carousel showcasing movies and series released in the current year.
- **Manual Search**: Users can manually search for movies or series, with options to filter between all, movies, or series. The search function also supports alternative titles.
- **Details Page**: Users can access detailed information about movies and series. They can also add items to their favorites, and if notifications are enabled, they will receive local notifications about their favorites.
- **Season Information**: For series, users can explore additional information based on seasons.
